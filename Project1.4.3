Bias

#1 You're testing advertising emails for a bathing suit company and you test one version of the email in February and the other in May.
Contextual bias. Sending emails during different seasons (winter vs spring) exposes the test to a second variable (season) which
is not controlleld.

#2 You open a clinic to treat anxiety and find that the people who visit show a higher rate of anxiety than the general population.
Selection bias. People who go to a clinic to treat anxiety already have anxiety. Therefore, the population of people who go to this clinic
will certainly have higher rates of anxiety than the general population.

#3 You launch a new ad billboard based campaign and see an increase in website visits in the first week.
The experiment is missing a control group. If web visits have been increasing over time, then this outcome would be expected with or 
without the billboard campaign.

#4 You launch a loyalty program but see no change in visits in the first week.
Measuring loyalty over a one week period is likely too short. What is the average lenght of time between website visits for  'loyal' 
customers? Perhaps only very few customers return within one week, even loyal customers. Therefore, a one week period would not be 
a long enough period of time to measure loyalty.
