1. Which product would create the highest expected value if featured in an ad campaign?

Approach: Determine the expected value of an ad campaign for each product, where expected value is expected revenue less cost. 

Expected revenue: (expected # ad clicks for product x) * (conversion rate for x) * (avg quantity sold of x) * (price x)

Cost: (avg quantity sold) * (cost product x) + (# ad clicks) * (cost per click)

Taking expected revenue less cost will provide an initial data point for the value to the company of an add campaign. 

The analysis could then be further supported by looking at: How an ad for a particular product affects conversion rates for
all products (not just the target); how likely a customer is to return after making a purchase of product x, y or z, etc.


2. Why have signups to the company's website slowed? 

Approach: First, understand where traffic has slowed over the past three years. Aggregate the total number of customers that signup, 
conversion rate of signups to plan selection and conversion rate from plan selection to payments. Analyze over an annual, monthly and/or
weekly basis.

If # customers that signup has slowed, look at marketing spend to see whether it has coincided with falling marketing spend.

If the conversion rate to plan selection has slowed, look at how long customers spend looking at each plan. 
Need to also understand whether plan selection has changed at all over the past 3 years.

If the conversion rate to the payment has slowed, look to see if payment options have changed or whether customers are spending too much
time on the payment page (indication that payment process might be broken)

3. Propose better hotel ranking system

Approach: Develop ranking system that ranks options that customers are more likely to select highest - i.e., highest conversion rate.

Run a regression on historical data to see how each factor is associated with higher conversion rates. 
Dependent var = conversion rate
Indep vars = price, availability, and 'session information' data (hotel site visits, length of stay)  

4. Is current churn atypical?

Approach: 
Start by looking at absolute gross churn - total # users that dropped out in each of past 3 years. See if there
is a particular period where churn spiked.

Break out churn rate by new vs existing users (users active during first month of first year).

For new users, calculate the share of new subscribers in a particular month dropped out over the next 1, 6, 12, etc months.

For existing users, calculate a similar survival rate over the next 1, 6, 12, etc. months
