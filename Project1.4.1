A/B Testing

#1 Does a new supplement help people sleep better?
From a random selection of participants, randomly assign participants to two groups - a control and test group. The control group 
includes participants that do not take a supplement and the test group includes participants that do. Test the hypothesis that 
the supplement will help the participants sleep better as measured by an increase in the hours of REM sleep per night. Before running
the test, ensure that the test and control group have a sufficient number of patients that self-report that they do not get enough
sleep. Also, review samples to ensure that the populations are relatively similar across key other independent variables (e.g., age, 
history of sleep issues, medication use, etc.).

#2 Will new uniforms help a gym's business?
A gym is (likely) a very seasonal business because they likely see customers ebb and flow during certain times of the year (e.g., influx 
of driven new customers right after new year's). Therefore, controling for seasonality is important. Ideally, the gym is a chain and has 
multiple locations so that the test and control group can be run at the same time. In that case, randomly assign certain locations to wear 
the new uniform; the other locations will continue to wear the old uniform. Test the hypothesis that the gyms with the new uniforms will 
see an increase in business measured by the ratio of total monthly personal-training revenue to average monthly customers, per location. 
Run the experiment for 6-12 months. Determine whether the test group experienced a significant increase in the key metric. Look to see
if any secondary outcomes were impacted such as monthly customer growth, retail sales growth, and reduced customer turnover.  

#3 Will a new homepage improve my online exotic pet rental business?
Create second version of the homepage and randomly route half of the traffic to the website to the original and half to the new homepage.
Test the hypothesis that the new page will increase revenues. Run the experiement for long enough to capture sufficient data and compare 
the total revenue under each group. Look at underlying drivers of revenue such as customer engagement (e.g., how long they spent on the 
website, number of clicks) repeat customers and growt hin new customers.

#4 If I put 'please read' in the email subject will more people read my emails?
Randomly assign recipients of an email to a control and test group, where the test group receives the 'please read' email headline.
Test the hypothesis that the percentage of recipients that receive and open the 'please read' email headline is higher than that of the 
control. Run the test over a number of emails and analyze how the metric changes over time.
