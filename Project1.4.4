Evaluate an experiment analysis. Describe flaws and ways to improve

#1 The Sith Lords are concerned that their recruiting slogan, "Give In to Your Anger," isn't very effective. Darth Vader develops 
an alternative slogan, "Together We Can Rule the Galaxy." They compare the slogans on two groups of 50 captured droids each. In 
one group, Emperor Palpatine delivers the "Anger" slogan. In the other, Darth Vader presents the "Together" slogan. 20 droids 
convert to the Dark Side after hearing Palpatine's slogan, while only 5 droids convert after hearing Vader's. The Sith's data scientist 
concludes that "Anger" is a more effective slogan and should continue to be used.

>>> Observer bias. The test introduced a second variable - different proctors - that was not controlled for in the experiment. Vader and 
Palpatine are two very different characters with very different powers of pursusion. Therefore, the conversion rate of each group may 
not be entirely attributed to the slogan. Using the same proctor for both test groups could control for this issue.


#2 In the past, the Jedi have had difficulty with public relations. They send two envoys, Jar Jar Binks and Mace Windu, to four friendly 
and four unfriendly planets respectively, with the goal of promoting favorable feelings toward the Jedi. Upon their return, the envoys 
learn that Jar Jar was much more effective than Windu: Over 75% of the people surveyed said their attitudes had become more favorable 
after speaking with Jar Jar, while only 65% said their attitudes had become more favorable after speaking with Windu. This makes Windu 
angry, because he is sure that he had a better success rate than Jar Jar on every planet. The Jedi choose Jar Jar to be their 
representative in the future.

>>> It is possible that Windu had a better success rate than Jar Jar on every planet but still have a lower overall favorability rating 
due to the Simpson's Paradox. There are two clear groups in this sample - favorable and unfavorable planets. It must be the case that
Jar Jar's overall score is weighted to a greater degree by the favorable planets than for Windu. To fix this, Windu and Jar Jar must talk 
to the same number of people in favorable and unfavorable planets.

#3 A company with work sites in five different countries has sent you data on employee satisfaction rates for workers in Human Resources 
and workers in Information Technology. Most HR workers are concentrated in three of the countries, while IT workers are equally distributed
across worksites. The company requests a report on satisfaction for each job type. You calculate average job satisfaction for HR and for 
IT and present the report.

>>> The job satisfaction scores for HR workers will be biased towards three countries. To correct for this, job satisfaction scores 
can be reported by country. 

#4 When people install the Happy Days Fitness Tracker app, they are asked to "opt in" to a data collection scheme where their level of
physical activity data is automatically sent to the company for product research purposes. During your interview with the company, they
tell you that the app is very effective because after installing the app, the data show that people's activity levels rise steadily.

>>> Selection bias. The people who download the tracker app are people who want to improve their fitness. The app may not have any 
effect because these people are likely to improving their fitness with or without the app. A couple ways to correct for this. 
One is to take a random sample of people and randomly assign them to two groups - one group downloads the app and the other 
does not - and compare the results of their activity level. Another fix is to create two versions of the app - one that works as intended
and the other that does not - and randomly assign users to each. 

#5 To prevent cheating, a teacher writes three versions of a test. She stacks the three versions together, first all copies of Version A,
then all copies of Version B, then all copies of Version C. As students arrive for the exam, each student takes a test. When grading the 
test, the teacher finds that students who took Version B scored higher than students who took either Version A or Version C. She concludes
from this that Version B is easier, and discards it.

>>> Assignment to condition bias. The test is handed out as students arrive so that Version A goes to the students who arrive the
earliers, Version C to the students who arrive last and Version B to those who arrived in the middle. By not randomly assigning
tests to the students, the teacher introduced a second variable (time that student arrives to class) that is not controlled.
