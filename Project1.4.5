Write up the essential points of a research proposal for an improved version of that experiment.

ORIGINAL
When people install the Happy Days Fitness Tracker app, they are asked to "opt in" to a data collection scheme where their level of
physical activity data is automatically sent to the company for product research purposes. During your interview with the company, they
tell you that the app is very effective because after installing the app, the data show that people's activity levels rise steadily.

IMPROVED
People who download fitness apps are motivated to improve their fitness and need help doing so for a number of reasons. Some of the 
top reasons include: motivation, structure and help with goal-setting.

The Happy Days Fitness Tracker app helps people improve their fitness by giving users a daily 'nudge' to motivate them
to get out and exercise. We believe that motivating users in this way will increase their overall activity level and  
fitness. Users of our app will be more engaged with physical activity as measured by average intensity minutes per 
week. 

Take a random sample of people and randomly and give everyone a fitness tracker. Ask to opt-in to data sharing and track their baseline
activity levels. After baseline is measured, assign each person to one of two groups - those that download the Fitness app (test group) and
those that do not (control). For each person in each group, measure changes in average intensity minutes per week. Do this for 2 or more 
months. If the intensity minutes per week is statistically significant and higher in the test vs control group, that would support
the hypothesis that the app helps to motivate users to exercise more.
