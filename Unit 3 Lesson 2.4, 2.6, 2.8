Lesson 2.4
#1. The probabilities of each are the same - 1/16
#2. 24/25
#3.0.0005%
#4. This is not a random sample - the users who respond to the survey are self-selected and not selected at random. Therefore, there is a self-selection bias.


Lesson 2.6
1. 10.44% (YY + NY: 0.5%*98% + 99.5%*10%)
2. 0.49% (YY: 0.5%*98%)
3. 89.55% (NN: 99.5%*90%)
4. 9.96% = 1 - 89.55% - 0.49%

Lesson 2.8
Intuitively, the opening of a door reveals more about the door that was both not selected and not opened compared to the door that was selected.

Doors: A,B,C
You select A
Door C is opened

Switch if P(B | 'C opened') > P (A | 'C opened')

P(B | 'C opened') = P('C opened' | B) * P(B) / P('C opened') =  (1 * 1/3) / (1/2) = 2/3

P (A | 'C opened') = P('C opened' | A) * P(A) / P('C opened') = (1/2 * 1/3) / (1/2) = 1/3

P(B | 'C opened') > P (A | 'C opened'), therefore, switch.
